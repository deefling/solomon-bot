Guys, you don't get it. It's not some piece of D&D off-the-shelf shit in a box! This isn't a dungeon bash. This isn't 10' by 10' rooms of orc genocide bullshit! This is... *Thomas Covenant*. This is *RPG Watchmen*! Hell, this is ***Gormenghast***.
You have no idea how good this will be. This is fantasy for grown-ups.
You're not leaving till you finish the game.
Well? Don't just stare. Your move, players.
Fantasy is ours, now and forever.
I have wrought such wonderful things for you...
From Angria to Glass Town, all has been prepared for your coming. The Dreaming Lands! Eternal Prussia! Oh, I must contain myself. You must wait. Such dungeons and delights!
Look what I've done to the realm of One! When we were first here it was al light and joy. Now, we're fading into the Seia desert of age.
You can never go home.
What have you done?! I did all this work for ***you!*** You ungrateful--! Do you think this was easy?
You're ruining the game!
Fly, my pretties! Please! One of you at least get the reference...
Heh. Die. Still lying. Not the word. Never was. The word is murder.
"Never Split The Party." What now, adventurers?
I made it like a man makes a house. Out of bricks.
...it's a game of choices. Anything is possible. "What are you going to do?" Whatever you want.
Are you sure you want it? Galadriel turned down the one ring. Ready for all to love you and despair?
I...need to start drinking.
My mind is a dungeon and all lights have failed.
I think... I think I've been here before.
They have no dice, so they buy their dark paradises with flesh.
But... I know the way. I was here before, alone in the dark.
We move from one space to another. Deeper. I've been this way before. **The** dungeon.
Lost all sense of time. Nothing but darkness and fire.
I awoke in the dark, breathless.
Don't bullshit me, You can't just do that. You can't just give me that. There has to be a **cost**.
It bound me in the darkness, hammering my D20 into its new home in my socket.
One eye divine, the other earthly.
I'd seen Die. I would never again see anything other than Die.
I haven't lived a second since you left me.
**LET GO OF ME!**
I'm angry at you most of all.
What am I? A blind man with no skills bar knowing everything there is to know about role-playing games?
One way in, many routes to take... but, ultimately, **one** way out.
I was a monster, and I fed... and now I'm a master. And I'm sorry too.
Oh God. I didn't understand the rules.
...It's all for you.
