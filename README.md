Hello, welcome to Solomon-bot

I'll be sharing this to a somewhat public audience & I don't want my bot's vulnerabilities to be exposed so here's how to set up your own version:
make an app on the discord developer portal
make a .env file

make a mongodb server on atlas

don't forget to npm -i

npm run dev
npm run deploy
npm run roll
